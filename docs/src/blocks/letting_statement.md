# Letting Statement

Used to define a variables' domain. This must be nested in a 'letting' block.

For example, it can be used like this:

![Example of a letting statement](../images/letting_statement_example.png)

Which would produce the following Essence output:

```essence
letting x be domain int ( 0 .. 5  )
```
