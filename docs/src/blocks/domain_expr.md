# Domain Expression

Defines the domain.

The domains we currently support are:
- boolean 
- integer

For example, it can be used like this:

![Example of a domain expression](../images/domain_expr_example.png)

Which would produce the following Conjure Output:

```essence
domain int ( 0 .. 5  )
```
