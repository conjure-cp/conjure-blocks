# Exponent

Defines the exponent of an integer.

For example, `2^5` is defined in Conjure Blocks as follows:

![Example of an exponent expression](../images/exponent_example.png)

Where the top value is the base, and the bottom is the exponent. 

This would produce the following Essence Output:

```essence
2 ** 5 
```
