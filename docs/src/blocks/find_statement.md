# Find Statement Assignment

This block is used to declare decision variables. It must be nested in a `find` block.

For example, it can be used like this:

![Example of a find statement](../images/find_statement_example.png)

Which would produce the following Conjure Output:

```essence
find  x : int (  0 .. 10  ) 
```
